# goal

summarize graphs with node/edge attributes

# grouping-based approach

SNAP: attribute and edge relation homogeneity based on (A, R)-compatible

- data-based style summarization
- multi-resolution (zoom on/out)

CANAL: extends to numerical values

interestedness defined by:

- diversity
- coverage
- conciseness


# compression-based

information theoretic approach: MDL principle

hashing


# influence based

visualize influence in a citation graph, **Shi Tong TKDE 2015**
