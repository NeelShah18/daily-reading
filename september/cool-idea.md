# function embedding

given a piece of software with source code, can we project the *functions* into a lower dimensional space using the calling relationship between functions. 

do we need it? is the calling relation DAG sufficient?

## usefulness

visualization of the functions so we know the bigger picture.

# repository alignment

given two repositories and the functions in each of them, can we align the functions so that two similar functions from each repo are aligned. 

## usefulness

compare two repositories. what they have and we they don't have. 

# graph summarization using embedding

open question: can we utility graph embedding techniques for graph summarization tasks?

- what's the general use of graph embedding?
- what are the tasks for graph summarization?

# faster deep learning for xml learning

prediction for the SIGIR 2017 paper is slow because it needs to evaluate all the labels. 

can we make it faster?
