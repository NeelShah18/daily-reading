# function embedding

given a piece of software with source code, can we project the *functions* into a lower dimensional space using the calling relationship between functions. 

do we need it? is the calling relation DAG sufficient?

## usefulness

visualization of the functions so we know the bigger picture. 

# repository alignment

given two repositories and the functions in each of them, can we align the functions so that two similar functions from each repo are aligned. 

## usefulness

compare two repositories. what they have and we they don't have.
