proved deepwalk can be viewed a matrix factorization problem

now how to add text and still model it as a MF problem?

- take one of the two factor matrices
- factor it further into a feature matrix and another smaller matrix

benefits:

- a way to incorporate text features
- reduces parameter size as well
