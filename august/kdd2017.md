# unsupervised feature selection in signed social networks

- [paper](http://www.public.asu.edu/~jundongl/paper/KDD17_SignedFS.pdf)
- problem: as the name suggests
  - select most relevant features by exploiting feature matrix and sign matrix
- not sure why this problem matters

# LiJAR: A System for Job Application Redistribution towards Efficient Career Marketplace

- job recommendation system in LinkedIn causes some problem: the number of applications on different jobs are un-even
- job redistribution: how to make it even


# Cascade Ranking for Operational E-commerce Search

- a new cascade ranking model
- cascade model: users view results from top to bottom and leave as soon as they see a worthwhile document, is our best explanation for position bias in early ranks
  - related to user bias from presentation order
  - source paper [An Experimental Comparison of Click Position-Bias Models](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13d7/2ef522b405c18f7d228c5744687609b4c3a4.pdf)

# Deep Choice Model Using Pointer Networks for Airline Itinerary Prediction

- problem: airline itinerary prediction
- choice model
  - Discrete Choice Modeling techniques, such as Multinomial Logit model
- a new choice model based on pointer network (RNN + attention)
- Amadeus is a provider of technology solutions to the travel and tourism industry.

# FIRST: Fast Interactive Attributed Subgraph Matching

problem:

- graph matching problem given query
  - essentially graph isomorphism
- in attributed graph
- interactive/**incremental** (speed requirement)

example application:

- team finding in a staff network (one leader connected to project managers, each project manager conencted to 2 engineers)

# Predicting Optimal Facility Location Without Customer Locations

- facility location problem: placement of facilities s.t. the "transportation cost" is minimized  (max? mean?)
  - analagous to clustering problem?
- NP-hard on general graph 
  - O(\log n) approx algorithm exists


# A Taxi Order Dispatch Model based On Combinatorial Optimization

- two problems:
  - optimal matches between drivers and riders: to maximize the "global" rider acceptance rate 
    - naive approach: select the nearest driver for a request (attains local optimal)
  - predict destination of riders
- by Didi!

my thinking:

- a bipartite graph: driver/rider on two sides
- maximize the number of matched pairs while minimizing the total edge weight
  - edge weight is the distance between rider and driver

# Learning Tree-Structured Detection Cascades for Heterogeneous Networks of Embedded Devices

cascaded learning: multi-stage ensemble learning
  - using outputs from multiple classifiers
  - but not voting or stacking but in stages

example:
  - holistic understanding of images requires solving different subproblems: labeling, obejct detection, scene detection, etc
    - [relevant paper](https://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/Papers/Heitz+al:NIPS08a.pdf)
  - in the paper: a set of sensors (watch, mobile phone, heart-rate band), each serving as a classifier
    - goal might be: detecting the activity

this paper also focuses on energy efficiency
