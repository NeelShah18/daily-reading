tasks:

- knowledge graph completion: triplet completionx
- entity classification

# background

- linear translation based score (Bordes et al. 2013)
- NTN (Socher et al. 2013) 
- uses word embedding (Zhang et al. 2015), however order is not considered.


# this model

- CNN is used to model text
- linear translation based triplet score (Bordes, 2013)
