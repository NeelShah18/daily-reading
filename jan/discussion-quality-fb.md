# problem

what are the effects of two different comment ranking algorithm (social-feedback, most recent) have on participators' behaviours?

behaviours include:

- the quality of the comments being viewed
- the quality of the comments being written as response


- try to have minimal effect on the users: requiring large number of participants
- within-subject experiments: the same subject appears in multiple trials
- spill-over effects: treatment will affect control group (especially for within-subject experiments)
- two level randomization: why?
