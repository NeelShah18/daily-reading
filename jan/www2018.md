## [ ] Social Rank Regulated Large-scale Network Embedding

- breaks the assumption of connectiviyy-based proximity measure
- rank/popularity based, two nodes are similar if they have similar ranks

## Minimizing Polarization and Disagreement in Social Networks

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09948.pdf
- combinatorial optimization
- with approimation gaurantee

## Minimizing Latency in Online Ride and Delivery Services

- variant of multi-vehicle minimum latency problems: route a set of vehicles located at depots to serve requests located at different points in a metric space so as to minimize the total latency
  - drone delivery, uber/didi taxi scheduling, 

## [ ] TIMES: Temporal Information Maximally Extracted from Structures

- https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/TIMES-Temporal-Information-Maximally-Extracted-fro-/6dabb2e08b3879a26f89932313356aa5cbc56768
  - might be out of date
- inferring the node arrival sequence from a snapshot of a dynamic network
  - what's a snapshot
  - what's a dynamic network (why preferential attachment)
  - has application in source identification


## [ ] Deep Collective Classification in Heterogeneous Information Networks

- collective classification: labels within a group of instances are correlated and should be inferred collectively, instead of independently.
  - examples?
- convolution based
