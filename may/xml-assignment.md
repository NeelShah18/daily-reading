# second derivative of a vector

identity matrix, not 1 (scalar)

in general, the derivative of one vector w.r.t another vector is a matrix. 

refer to [section 5](https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/MatrixCalculus.pdf)

# sum of $`x_i d_i x_i^T`$, where $`x`$ is column vector

can be summarized in matrix form: $`X D X^T`$, where $`X=[x_1, \ldots, x_n]`$ and $`D_{ii} = d_i`$ (diagonal matrix)
