# random walk and speed of convergence

https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws11/SGT/Lecture6.pdf

just the result in [(end of this ) this article](december/thomas-random-walks-and-markov-chains.md)

proof in section 1. 

note:

- `\alpha_1=1` not `\alpha_i`
- `v_1, \ldots, v_n` are the eigen vectors
- line 3 of the equations in page 2 uses the orthnormal property
