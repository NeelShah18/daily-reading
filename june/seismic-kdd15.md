# SEISMIC: A Self-Exciting Point Process Model for Predicting Tweet Popularity

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02594.pdf

goal: predicting the *ultimate popularity* of a post

- based on self-exicting point process

advantages:

- in contrast to feature-based approach, this model is *generative*
  - post infectiousness is modeled dynamically
- does not require the complete graph but just the time history of reshares andthe degrees of the resharing nodes.
