# Rise and Fall Patterns of Information Diffusion: Model and Implications

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/PUBLICATIONS/kdd12-riseNfall.pdf

# contribution

a unified model that captures the evolving patterns of information diffusion

- formulated as one equation with a few parameters
- purely time-series
- borrows idea from self-excited Hawkes process (a modified version of Poisson process)

possible application:

- popularity forecasting
- anomaly detection
- for understanding the behaviour
