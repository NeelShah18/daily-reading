# VC dimension

informally, the separating capability of a function family

- an exammple for function family is a set of hyperplanes to separate data points

**separate capability**

the maximum number of any sets of data points (with arbirary label assignment) that at least one member in the family can separate *perfectly* (aka *shatter*)

# example

function family = 2D space (a line)

VC dimension = 3

for $`n=4`$, there are some cases that a line cannot separate perfectly.
