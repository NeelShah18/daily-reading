- [RaRE: Social Rank Regulated Large-scale Network Embedding](http://yangy.org/works/ge/rare.pdf)
  - bayesian approach, then how to train 
  - and how to evaluate with rank related concern

- [VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04742.pdf)
  - baselines are not very strong

- [Co-Regularized Deep Multi-Network Embedding](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3178876.3186113)
  - multi-layer networks in which the entities in each layer can be of different domains (user/image/text)
  - looks quite useful (stackoverflow data, citation network, etc)

# application

## [Collective Classification of Spam Campaigners on Twitter: A Hierarchical Meta-Path Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04168)

goal: spam detection on phone *number-based* compaigns (supervised learning)

- a proximity measure based on meta-path
- active learning approach to overcome insufficient training instances for supervised learning


## [Measuring and Improving the Core Resilience of Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3186127)

propose:

- measure resilience: two node properties to measure it
- improve resilience: an algorithm to improve the resilience
