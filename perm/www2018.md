# embedding papers

- [RaRE: Social Rank Regulated Large-scale Network Embedding](http://yangy.org/works/ge/rare.pdf)
  - bayesian approach, then how to train 
  - and how to evaluate with rank related concern

- [VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04742.pdf)
  - baselines are not very strong

- [Co-Regularized Deep Multi-Network Embedding](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3178876.3186113)
  - multi-layer networks in which the entities in each layer can be of different domains (user/image/text)
  - looks quite useful (stackoverflow data, citation network, etc)


# social media

- [X] [Mapping the Invocation Structure of Online Political Interaction](apr/invocation-graph.md)
- [ ] [Demarcating Endogenous and Exogenous Opinion Diffusion Process on Social Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3186121)
  - classifify users and opinion by organic/extrinsic and endogenous/exogenous
  - e.g, anger by himself or contagious?
