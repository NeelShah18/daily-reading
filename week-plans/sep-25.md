- read about active learning in general
- read about graph inference problems (what I read in KDD 2017)
- find other graph inference problems in kdd papers

- extreme multi-label learning: faster prediction. can I borrow the idea from sparse local embedding paper

- experiment for rejected paper
  - separate the code
  - my own graph library
