- [ ] discussion (2h)


## frog

supermodular function:

- http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~shaddin/cs599fa13/slides/lec24.pdf
- increasing marginal returns

nash equilibrium:

## problem formulation

given a non-negative $`w_k`$ weight for each core $`k`$, add $`b`$ edges to maximize

$`\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} w_k size(shell_k)`$

`w_k` can be related to the lower bound in the network games. 

learned

- games on network
  - not sure why supermodularity is important
- relation between largest nash equilibria and core number (lower bound)
- proposed a problem formulation on maximization some function on k-core
