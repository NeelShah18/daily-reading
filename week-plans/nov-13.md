# plan

** immunization **

- [ ] sub/super modularity of our model: prove or disprove
- [ ] k-core based formulation: add edges to increase total increase of core number:
  - [ ] what's the motivation (.5h)? 
  - [ ] prove its sub/super modularity (1h)
  - [ ] present the formulation to Lorenzo and Francesco (1h)
- [ ] ask Cigdem if there is any model related to dynamicaly evaluated edge probabilities (0.5h)

** active learning **

- [ ] understand the query process
  - try more examples
- [ ] precision/recall using sampling based inference
- [ ] precision/recall using inference method in SDM submission


** multi-label **

- [ ] search for approaches using label embedding (1h)
- [ ] difference to related work
- [ ] write down my idea formally
- [ ] present it Fan

** mini hackathon

- [ ] understand the paper
- [ ] implement it in Keras
- [ ] experiemt: network reconstruction, classification


# Monday

- frog: sub/super modularity of our model (3h)
- Fast semi differential- based submodular function optimization (1.5h)
- report precision/recall and/or precision@k (1.5h)
  - sampling-based  
  - SDM submission method
  - on grid, dolphin, karate club
- present result to Cigdem (1h)
  - also ask her about cascade model dynamically evaluated edge probabilities 

# Tuesday

- frog: k-core based
