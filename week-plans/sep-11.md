- deep walk + xml learning
  - [ ] deep walk training
  - [ ] combine with xml
  - [ ] evaluation 
- active learning
  - [X] find source code for infection status inference and source finding (based on observed infections without timestamps)
    - comment: failed to find any
  - [ ] min steiner tree-based inference algorithm
    - `infinf`: get the 
    - `source`: ranked by distance to all other terminals (plus exponential function)
  - [ ] implement active learning framework: query a node, update the result
  - [ ] different query-selection baselines: by node degree, pagerank, random, etc
  - [ ] evaluate the method with baselines
    - `infinf`: precision, recall
    - `source`: precision@k
- [ ] efficient determinant computation using JMLR paper: input - sparse matrix, output - estimated determinent
- why determinant-based score mimics energy function
