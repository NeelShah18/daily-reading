  - [X] min steiner tree-based inference algorithm for inferring missing nodes
  - [X] implement active learning framework: query a node, update the result
  - [X] different query-selection baselines: by node degree, pagerank, random, etc
  - [X] evaluate the method with baselines for inferring missing nodes
- experiment
  - [X] pagerank with personalized vector on infected nodes
  - [ ] optimize extract steiner tree
  - [ ] experiment on small graphs
- [ ] efficient determinant computation using JMLR paper: input - sparse matrix, output - estimated determinent
