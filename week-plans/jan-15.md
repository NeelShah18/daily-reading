# plan

## NetFill experiment for KDD submission and SDM paper

- [ ] learn how to run NetFill
- [ ] Python interface for NetFill (2h)

## SDM paper

- [ ] report experiment on small datasets
- [ ] case study on small datasets	
  - graph topology visualization
  - node states viz

## KDD submission

goal: by next Friday.

- experiment comparing different query strategies
- experiment comparing different sampling strategies
- the algorithm/implementation is optimized

- writing for query stretagy part 
- unify the 


## core maximization

goal: some algorithm inspires from the optimal solution on karate club (based on subcore algorithm)

- [ ] state the difference between version with given candidate set of edges and with the complementary edge set 
- [ ] subcore algorithm: after matching as many nodes, what to do with the rest unmatched nodes? how to maximize the gain?


# monday

- [ ] frog: ML coffee talk (1h)
- [ ] profile code for entropy method (1h)
  - what's the bottle neck, optimize it? (?h)
- [ ] review optimizing scalability using lazy evaluation (0.5 h)
- [ ] is it appliable to entropy/prediction error method (0.5 h)
- [ ] if applicable, state it in the document (0.5h)
- [ ] meeting (1h)
  - current progress
  - scalability issue
- [ ] extract the subgraph of the karate club and investigate what's the case of the optimal solution for greedy (1h)
  - could subcore algorithm be applied to this case?
