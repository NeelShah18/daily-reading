- reconstructing cascade
  - [X] plot the evaluation figure (then let's see)
  - [ ] at least produce some consistent result, if not, understand why
  - [ ] minimum steiner tree in C++
  - [ ] run on slashdot and dblp datasets
  - [X] MCC evaluation
  - [X] ic and sp model
  - [ ] q to 1.0
- real cascade (reconstruction)
  - [X] find the dataset
  - [ ] run the experiment
  - [ ] interpret the result
- paper submission
  - [X] abstract, October 6, 2017 11:59PM (US Pacific Time):
  - [ ] October 13, 2017 11:59PM (US Pacific Time)
- [X] what are the applications for community searching
- [X] community query tutorial 
- [ ] what are the recommendation in twitter? different recommendation task? different query type?
- [X] k-core/k-truss structure in heterogenous or multilayer network
  - why is it a cool topic? meta-path based k-core give different semantics for defining closenss
  - what is clear now: k should differ by the meta-path, for example, PCP should have k=1, because a paper can be accepted into only on conference
  - what is not clear now: 
    - what is a query like? one or more nodes? one or more types?
    - how to design the meta-paths and k values for certain goals? like what are the close collaborators with Francesco that they tend to publish into the same conference? 
    - how to find the k-core given a list of meta-paths? 

- [X] public/pricate network: what are they? why are they interesting and what are the challenges?
- [X] collect the community search papers into mendeley
