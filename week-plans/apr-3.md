1. why sampling on lattice-1024  is not accurate?
   - what's the relation between num. terminals and sampling accuracy?
   - [X] relation to the large `f/g` (thin tails of `g`)
   - considering inactive edges in the target distribution
2. show the three plots, varying on
   1. num. terminals
   2. num. samples
   3. graph size
3. document on `edge_dag`
