# plan

## core maximization


- [ ] visualize the result (added edge, red)
- [ ] exhausive search (2h)
- [ ] experiment on grqc graph
- [ ] present result to Lorenzo and Francesco (1h)


## active learning

thinking:

- [ ] Is closure based sampling equivalent to wilson's version

coding:

- [ ] implement wilson's algorithm on steiner tree
- [ ] integrate it into `graph_tool`
- [ ] sample pool class that handles sample generation, update, etc
- [ ] speed comparison (with/without incremental update)

reading:

- [ ] time analysis of wilson algorithm
- [ ] unrooted version of wilson algorithm
- [ ] non-uniform random spanning tree (understand the proof)


# Sunday

- frog: [ ] think about the nc id that should be attached (1h)
- [ ] implement the above (1.5h)
- [ ] cikm (0.5h)
- [ ] `maintain` and `greedy` (2h)
- [ ] python interface and try on karate graph (1h)
