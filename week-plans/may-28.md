# Tuesday

- effect of roots on our method, can it beat pagerank?
  - [X] using true root: in some cases, it can beat pagerank
- [X] effect of resampling, does it improve the result?
  - re-sampling is hard because of the high variance

- [X] effect of num. samples
  - 5000 is totally sufficient
- [X] observing on leaves/bfs-head
  - fix cascade fraction, vary obs fraction
- more graphs




# thursday

- effect of true root on the two new graphs
- try real cascade
- more data sets (infrastructure graph, etc)
