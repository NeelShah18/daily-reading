- edmond's algorithm in C++
  - [X] read my own graph and do the computation
  - [X] wrap it in Python
  - [ ] accepts `min`, `max`, `roots` argument
- [X] optimize `build_closure`
  - only optimizes the `visitor` part
  - `cpbfs_search` not so trivial to optimize

  - [X] optimize extract steiner tree 
        - ended up not using C++
  - [X] re-use sampled spanning trees
  - [X] faster laplacian
        - not the crux, graph contraction is slow
  - [X] experiment using more trees
    - is there a case where PR is worse than our method?
