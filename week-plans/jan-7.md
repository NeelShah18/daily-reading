# plan

**core maximization**

- [ ] check Lorenzo's hardness proof (2h)
- [ ] see if it can be adapted to hardness proof of the single node version (1h)
- [ ] can we integrate our motivation with link prediction problems (according to topics, etc)? the objective contains both the recommendation score and core number

3h

**active learning**

- [ ] using bipartite graph as the data structure for faster statistic calculation (2h)
  - algorithm and time analysis (should be better than quadratic except indexing)
  - efficiently update (remove/and add trees)
- [ ] `inference.py` with incremental support (1h)
- [ ] integrate Polina's KDD 2016 method (2h)
  - goal: interface that inputs a set of activated nodes 
- [ ] experiment: SDM2018 under different query strategies on grqc (0.5h)
- [ ] experiment: Polina-KDD2016 under different query strategies on grqc (1h)
- [ ] summarize the comparison between cut and loop_erased (1h)
- [ ] meeting: (1h)
  - explain the the email on empirical tree distribution to true distribution
  - discuss experiment design
  - next plan

8.5h 

**SDM paper**

- [ ] summarize the meta-review (0.5h)
- [ ] ask Aris 
  - what should be done for the review
  - do I go to San Diego for conference
- [ ] upload to arxiv if no modificatio needed (0.5h)
- [ ] tweet on Twitter and Weibo about it if arxiv id done (0.5h)

1.5h

**presentation**

- [ ] read [matrix as factorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02971.pdf) (1h)
- [ ] slides making (3h)
  - ~ 40 pages
- [ ] some thinking on cascade embedding or network alignment

4h

**internship**

- [ ] ask Aris if it would be fine about the internship time frame

**reading**

- [Representation Learning of Knowledge Graphs with Entity Descriptions](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12216/12004) (0.5+0.5h)
- [Words are Malleable: Computing  Semantic Shifts in Political and  Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05603) (0.5+0.5h)
