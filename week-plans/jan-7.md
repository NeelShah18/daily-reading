## meeting


- [Towards identity anonymization on graphs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1376629)
- what's the minimum number of edges to add to promote a single subcore
- upperbound on a set of edges
- optimal solution for karate club: 
  - two edges span different subcores

action points:

- identify subcore but do not limit us to the subcore (neighboring nodes, even lower core nodes, can be benefited as well). a bit different from the previous intuition
- try other graphs to gain more intuition
- prove inapproximability: L-reduction
  - approximation preserving reduction
  - basad on reduction but preserve the approximation

# Thursday

- frog: [ ] find out why `cascade/grqc-s0.2-o0.1/91.pkl` never ends? (0.5h)
- [X] statistic calculator using 2d matrix as internal data structure (1.5h)
  - compare the time difference
- [X] presentation (1.5h)
  - gather feedback
  - encourage discussion
- [X] re-read subcore algorithm, find our what's wrong about the lemma (0.5h)
- [X] fix the wrong part, formalize the algorithm to find the set of edges, simulate on examples (1h)
- [ ] write the query strategy part (0.5h)
- [ ] case study, check other related papers on case studies (0.5h)
  - like news site dataset: does reconstructed tree reflect the infection order

## why never ends

located the problem and had two observations:

1. `graph_tool.Graph.remove_edge` fails to remove certain edges
2. `isolate_nodes` gives "kernel dies"

## presentation

feedbacks: 

- generally, it's a good summarization
- Aris questioned about the general property of word2vec formulation
- Kiran mentioned that graphsage has a natural structure for distributed computing

## max core

what's next:

- how to attach a single node
- design the greedy algorithm
- coding


# Friday

- [X] frog: case study, check other related papers on case studies (1h)
  - like news site dataset: does reconstructed tree reflect the infection order
- [X] update the subcore algorithm, change the setting to given a candidate edge set, and invalidate any subcores (1h)

## frog

- investigate on a small cascade on Digg, 
  - visualize the true cascade (on the small subgraph), node color as infection time
  - visualize also the reconstructed cascade (using 50% of the samples), node color as infection time 
  - does the two visualization match each other?
  - some example visualziation: https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/information_evolution_in_social_networks.pdf

- started to run experiments on small cascade

# Sunday

- takes a long time to sample one tree
  - related to how root are sampled
