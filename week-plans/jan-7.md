# plan

**core maximization**

- [ ] can we integrate our motivation with link prediction problems (according to topics, etc)? the objective contains both the recommendation score and core number

3h

**active learning**

- [ ] learn how to run NetFill (1h)
- [ ] experiment: SDM2018 under different query strategies on grqc (0.5h)
- [ ] summarize the comparison between cut and loop_erased (1h)
- [ ] Python interface for NetFill (2h)


8.5h 

**SDM paper**

- [ ] upload to arxiv if no modificatio needed (0.5h)
- [ ] tweet on Twitter and Weibo about it if arxiv id done (0.5h)

1.5h

**presentation**

- [ ] representation learning on bipartite graphs (with partial feature information)

4h

**internship**

one algorithm on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) per-day

- using python
- related to data structure (number theory is not very interesting)

  - [X] ask Aris 
    - what should be done for the review
    - do I go to San Diego for conference
- [X] one leet-code problem


## meeting

for kdd submission:

- two main sampling procedures 
  - think about the time version
- [ ] write down the query strategy part
- experiment (part 1 and 2)
- scalability (incremental update)

for SDM paper:

- [ ] the idea of model invariant should be stated more clearly (Polinaâ€™s paper)
- [ ] compare with NetFill under different cascade model
- [ ] experiment with small cascade


# Tursday

- [X] using bipartite graph as the data structure for faster statistic calculation (1h)
  - algorithm and time analysis (should be better than quadratic except indexing)
  - efficiently update (remove/and add trees)
- [X] search for real cascade data (1h)
- [ ] why the code never stops and consumes no CPU resources (1h)

## meeting


- [Towards identity anonymization on graphs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1376629)
- what's the minimum number of edges to add to promote a single subcore

action points:

- optimal solution for karate club: 
  - two edges span different subcores
  - identify subcore but do not limit us to the subcore (neighboring nodes can be benefited as well). a bit different from the previous intuition
- try other graphs to gain more intuition
- prove inapproximability: L-reduction
  - approximation preserving reduction
  - basad on reduction but preserve the approximation
