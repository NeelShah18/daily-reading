two days left... 

fine, let's stick the framework, 

1. detailed/technical reading 
2. thinking
3. coding/experiemtn
4. skimming


# Thursday

1. thinking: yesterday's approach (finding synergic edges and their dependency)
2. coding: 
   - [X] what francesco asked yesterday
   - fb plot
   - run the experiment on grqc
3. reading: surfing papers on (non-probabilistic/probabilistic) active learning, how to quantify uncertainty 
   - understood the main intuition of [entropy/cross-entropy/KL-divergence](mar/entropy-cross-entropy.md)
   - [X] [maximum expected cross entropy](http://www.filmnips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FILM-NIPS2016_paper_23.pdf)
4. skimming: two fb cascade papers
5. misc: discussion with Cigdem


# Friday

- experiment: interpret the experiment result
- thinking: more details on DAG contruction
- tech reading: how to prove inapproximability
- skimming: can cascade be predicted?
