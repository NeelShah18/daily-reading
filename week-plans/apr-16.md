- how to sample from `\Prod P(u, v)`
  - non-local verion of random walk 
  - probabislistic shortest path
  - probabilistic minimum spanning tree
  - [X] MCMC version of tree sampling
- grading
- apply for more resources from CSC

# monday

- [random steiner tree using MCMC](apr/mcmc-steiner-tree.md)
- [non adjacency edge dependency example(apr/non-adjacency-dependency-example.pdf)


## meeting

- try square loss, l1 loss or cross entropy loss
- try stochastic graph
- larger cascade
- why p2p rises the entropy? 
- why cond-entropy not good on entropy in GRQC?
