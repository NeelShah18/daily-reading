# Back to the Past: Source Identification in Diffusion Networks from Partially Observed Cascades

# continous time diffusion model

- cascade probability = product of individual node probability
- node probability depends on node's infection time and neighbors infection time.

# learned

- introduce auxilary variables to complete the integared variables to `V`
- the above enables importance sampling to be done (we sample casacade from a simpler distribution)
- understood equation 8
