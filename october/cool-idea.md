# (automatically) updating research papers of your own field

i am interested in graph mining and conferences such as kdd, icdm, vldb, etc

is there a tool that automatically pushes the new papers from this conferences each year?

two steps:

1. acquicision of the papers
2. filtering

# node embedding for public-private networks

# k-core for heterogenous information networks

# k truss for signed networks

what's the definition?
