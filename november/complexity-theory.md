# sharp p

refer the counting problems that are "hard". 

asks "how many" rather than "are there any" (decision)

# decision problem and optimization problem

to prove the NP-hardness of an optimization problem, we can recast it into a decision problem. 

if the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time, then optimization problem can also be solved in poly time (using binary search).
