# spectrogram

one representation for sound waveform (measure of air presure over time) transformed via fast fourier transform

- in one sentence: a series of volumes at distinct pitches ([reference](https://www.dataq.com/data-acquisition/general-education-tutorials/fft-fast-fourier-transform-waveform-analysis.html))
- y axis: frequency
- x axis: time
- color depth: amplitude (the darker, the higher)

can be visualized in 3D as well (color depth changes to height). 

## formant

like the main frequency during a period.
