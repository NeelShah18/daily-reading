# asymmetric k-center

select k centers (like k-median problem)

# symmetric version

NP-hard and 2-approximation exisits

if no triangle inequality, then no better than `O(logn)`.

# asymmetric version

`O(logn)` approximation

# questions

- does the directed metric graph satisfy triangle inequality?
- what if k=1?
