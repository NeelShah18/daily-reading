# quality measuresments

# autocorrelation

perfect case: auto-correlation between samples should be 0

the samples form a chain (time-series)

# correlation to real distribution

perfect case: should be 1

# difficulty

for combinatorial structure, the number of unique data points can be exponential

# comment on KL-divergence

don't use it as a real distance measure (it's not a metric).

usually, it used for optimization problem
