# goal

a temporal summary of graph or a set of structures

what is a good summary?

# common approaches

## static view

treat the temporal graphs as a seris of static graphs and apply static methods to each of them

time granularity is the challenge

still: how to summarize them

## aggregate approximate graph

link edges from different snapshots via kernel smoothing and apply static methods

# compression-based


Shah 2015.time-crunch

# influence-based

**Qu-14**: summarization of diffusion process

**Lin 08**: summarization of social activity

# applications

- visualization
- compression
- pattern discovery: time crunch
- influence analysis: Shi 15, Mehmood 13

# interesting open problem

- multi-layer network
- summarization based on representation learning
- temporal graph with side information (text, photo, etc)
  - event summarization
- graphs + time series
